                                =======

REQUIREMENTS
------------

- PHP >= 5.4
- PHP files upload support enabled
- MySQL or PostgreSQL
- PHP support for MySQL (MYSQLi) or PostgreSQL
- PHP extensions: zlib
- Optional PHP extensions: Curl, PCNTL, POSIX



INSTALLATION
------------

- Unpack the Innomatic archive, a folder named "innomatic" will be created.
Inside this folder, you'll find an index.php file and another "innomatic"
folder ("innomatic/innomatic"), that is the real public folder for Innomatic.
The index.php file is not a real public Web file, it is the common receiver for
the public webapps. If the first level Innomatic directory is left Web
publicly available, the index.php file will redirect the browser to "innomatic"
subfolder.

- Create a virtual host in your web server configuration for Innomatic public
folder (innomatic/innomatic), e.g. innomatic.mydomain.com.

- Point your browser to the newly created Innomatic virtual host and follow
the Web setup procedure.



SETTING UP DOMAIN WEBAPPS
-------------------------

When you create a new domain in the Innomatic Control Panel, a webapp folder
for that domain will be created in the first level Innomatic folder
("innomatic") aside the Innomatic webapp ("innomatic/innomatic").
You should create a virtual host for each webapp directory, if the domain
is meant to have a public webapp other than the domain desktop inside Innomatic.



UPGRADE
-------

You must upgrade Innomatic using the Applications panel in the Innomatic
Control Panel Web interface. Please use AppCentral to obtain a newer version
or manually upload the Innomatic archive file in the Applications panel just
as if you were installing or upgrading a Innomatic application.

Overwriting your current Innomatic installation with the content of the
Innomatic distribution archive files will result in irrecuperable damages.



INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE QUESTIONS
----------------------------------

Q. When I click on the "Next" button at the bottom of the page during "System
check" phase, nothing happens.

A. Check that the Innomatic directories have the right users and permissions.
Typical user/group for Apache is nobody:nogroup or apache:apache. The same
applies for Windows, you must ensure that the directories are writable by the
web server user.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Innomatic hangs after the installation or upgrade of a application.

A. The installation/upgrade process has been interrupted and the lock file
core/temp/upgrading_system has not been removed. Remove it accessing
[Innomatic Web URL]/root/unlock from your browser.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I'm unable to complete the database creation phase during setup.

A. This is likely to be a database permissions problem. You may try making
sure that the specified database user has access to the database not only from
localhost, but also by the IP address and domain name. Then change the default
localhost on the form to your domain. If this doesn'work, you may also try
with 127.0.0.1 as IP address, for certains setup this works.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. POST forms with attribute enctype="multipart/form-data" don't pass
parameters.

A. PHP must have file_uploads set to On in php.ini
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Since Innomatic archive size is greater than 2 megabytes I'm unable to
update it in the applications administration page.

A. The standard PHP upload file size limit is set to 2M. Increase it to a value
bigger than the Innomatic archive, e.g.: upload_max_filesize = 8M
